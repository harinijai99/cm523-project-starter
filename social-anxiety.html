        <h1>Social Anxiety</h1>
  
        <div class = "information">
            <h4>Social anxiety is common in any high pressure environment. It is a condition in which social interactions may cause irritation and anxiety. Everyday interactions with this condition may cause fear, stress and acute anxiety. It is common in college students when they are subject to strenuous classes, a new living environment and new social groups. Social anxiety may lead to other mental health impairments such as stress disorders, substance abuse, depression, sleep deprivation and anxiety.
            </h4>
      
        <p> Practice Mindfulness: The art of mindfulness allows an individual be present and make themselves more aware of their thoughts and feelings, when in a high-pressure environment. Practicing mindfulness involves breathing methods, guided imagery and meditation to relax the body and mind and helps reduce stress. Mindfulness makes one intensely aware of their thoughts and emotions and has proven effective in reducing anxiety. 
        </p>
        <p>Journaling:
          Journaling has proven to be one of the most effective methods in reducing stress, anxiety, and coping with various mental health issues. Journalling is simply the process of writing down one's thoughts and feelings in order to better understand, and eventually process them. Journaling can help gain control of your emotions and can serve as an outlet when one is unable to understand what they are feeling.
