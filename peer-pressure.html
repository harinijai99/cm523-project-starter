            <h5>Peer pressure occurs when a person is subject to undue social influence and the pressure to partake in activities that may cause discomfort. Most commonly reported in the student demographic, negative peer pressure makes one emotionally vulnerable and can give rise to a myriad of mental health issues including depression, social anxiety, substance abuse and so on. If left untreated it may even result in self harm and even result in the build of post traumatic stress.  
            </h5>

        <li>Engaging in activities that build self confidence: 
            The pressure of belonging and confirming to ideals you may not agree with, is the root of peer pressure. Thus, it is advisable to engage in activities that help build your self confidence and give you more clarity about your own ideals. Starting a new hobby, learning languages, taking up a part time job or even meeting a new group of people can help break the chain of peer pressure. </li>
        <li>Turning to a trusted group of people 
            It is advisable to have a trusted group of advisors, if you feel the burden of peer pressure. This trusted group can help give you claity and can help center your emotions. Talking to this group, a parent, a friend, a trusted relative, or even a guidance counsellor, will allow you to process your emotions and better prepare yourself for dealing with peer pressure. </li>
            <li>Setting boundaries: As simple as it may seem, setting healthy boundaries can help one better overcome the burden of peer pressure. Saying no in circumstances and deciding for yourself what is right and wrong, and what are the activities that you are willing and unwilling to participate in, can help avoid the stress and anxiety caused by peer pressure. Saying no will help you better understand your own limitations. </li>
