        <h1>Peer Pressure</h1>
        
        
        <div class = "information">
            <h4>Peer pressure occurs when a person is subject to undue social influence and the pressure to partake in activities that may cause discomfort. Most commonly reported in the student demographic, negative peer pressure makes one emotionally vulnerable and can give rise to a myriad of mental health issues including depression, social anxiety, substance abuse and so on.  
            </h4>
      
        <p><u><b>Engaging in activities that build self confidence:</b></u> 
            The pressure of belonging and confirming to ideals you may not agree with, is the root of peer pressure. Thus, it is advisable to engage in activities that help build your self confidence. By learning a new skill, engaging in physical activities or building a community of like minded people, you can build a stronger sense of self, and avoid the negative effects of peer pressure. </p>

Talking to them, will allow you to process your emotions and better prepare yourself for dealing with peer pressure.</p>
