        <p>Time management: As a student one is always faced with multitasking between classes, which more often than not can overwhelm you, effective time management can help ease your mental worries and make studying a less daunting task. It may not necessarily always be a boring task, time management can be made fun, here's a super fun technique to make it easier. The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique involves breaking work down into 25-minute intervals, called "pomodoros," separated by short breaks.
            Here are the steps of the technique:</p>
           <ol class = "pomodoro">
            <li>Choose a task to be accomplished.</li>
            <li>Set the Pomodoro timer (usually for 25 minutes).</li>
            <li>Work on the task until the timer rings.</li>
            <li>Take a short break (usually for 5 minutes).</li>
            <li> After four pomodoros, take a longer break (usually for 15-30 minutes).</li>
            <li>Repeat the process until the task is completed.</li>
           </ol>
