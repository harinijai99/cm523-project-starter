        <li>Time management: As a student one is always faced with multitasking between classes, which more often than not can overwhelm you, effective time management can help ease your mental worries and make studying a less daunting task. It may not necessarily always be a boring task, time management can be made fun, here's a super fun technique to make it easier. The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique involves breaking work down into 25-minute intervals, called "pomodoros," separated by short breaks.
            Here are the steps of the technique:
           <ol class = "pomodoro">
            <li>Choose a task to be accomplished.</li>
            <li>Set the Pomodoro timer (usually for 25 minutes).</li>
            <li>Work on the task until the timer rings.</li>
            <li>Take a short break (usually for 5 minutes).</li>
            <li> After four pomodoros, take a longer break (usually for 15-30 minutes).</li>
            <li>Repeat the process until the task is completed.</li>
           </ol>
        </li>  

        <li>Organizational tools (Planners, Scheduling, Note Taking):    
            Your organizational tools, like your calendar and schedule, should fit your needs and preferences. Some students may find physical planners and paper helpful, while others may prefer digital tools. Although your calendar can aid with long-term planning, most of these tools are designed to help prioritize tasks on a daily basis.
            
            Consider the following suggestions to find the organizational tools that work best for you:
