            <h5>Any learning environment is negatively impacted by discrimination against a group of individuals or bullying. This may range from casual remarks to physical abuse based on individual traits, or even a person's identity markers including but not limited to race, religion, ethnicity and sexual orientation. Students who are victims of such discrimination are more likely to experience acute stress disorders, eating disorders, depression, anxiety, suicidal ideation, Self harm and post traumatic stress disorders. 
            </h5>

        <li> Joining support groups: Support groups bring together a group of individuals going through similar emotions and life experiences and providesand opportunity for those individuals to share and express their thoughts, emotions, struggles, and even coping mechanisms. Support groups exist to reinforce the idea that no one is alone in their struggles. The shared life experiences among members of a support group can enable the sharing. </li>
        <li>Finding the best way to react: When dealing with bullying and discrimination, the victim often loses control of their emotions, thereby giving more power to the abuser. A coping mechanism in these circusmstances, involves finding the best way to react. That reaction may be as simple as laughing it off, retaliating in a calm and assertive manner, simply asking the other party to stop their taunts, or even reporting  the incidents to authority figures and people in a position of power.
